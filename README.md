# jacks (card game)

an online version of the solitare card game jacks

i added a bot to it that plays the game perfectly so that i could approximate the win/loss ratio for jacks


the aim of jacks is to go through the entire deck, and you can only have 9 cards on the table at once.

if you click on two cards that add to 11 or if you click on a king, queen and jack it will swap those cards with some from the top of the shuffled deck.

if there are no more options then you will lose, the game is 100% luck.

there is a win and loss counter that will automatically update as you play.


the odds of winning this game (calculated by letting it play 100000 games) is around 16.4%


i plan to make a counter with the remaining number of cards in the deck and make it look a lot nicer, but the functionality is there right now.
